      I know you would probably be wondering why is this my second webpage, well its a long story.

Joker once said
<blockquote><pre>Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars.
I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it!
You know, I just... *do* things.</pre></blockquote>
